# Installation

Basic installation can be achieved by cloning the Git repository.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies must be met in order to run the code:

 * Python 2.7.x or greater (not tested under Python 3 but should work)

## Configuration

A list of people and their interests/technologies needs to be created and
placed in a file called `people.json`. See `people-sample.json` for an example
